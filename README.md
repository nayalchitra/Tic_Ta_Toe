# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3*3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,vertical or diagonal row wins the game. When there is not a single free slot in the grid, and neither player has managed to mark a winning row, then it is a tie.
